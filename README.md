To update the deployed Github site:

1.  Update the `dev-branch` (either directly or using a pull request)
2.  From the `dev-branch`, run `npm run build` in your terminal
3.  Once `npm run build` is complete, run `npm run deploy` in your terminal
4.  You're all set! The site should reflect the new updates within a few minutes.

_**Note:** When making updates to the site, DO NOT push to master. The master branch will be automatically updated when you run the commands `npm run build` and `npm run deploy`._

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
